# Maroon

A module to make pure DCI available in Ruby

## Installation

    gem 'maroon'

And then execute:

## Usage

Essentially you can define a context by using

Context.define :context_name do
   role :role_name do
      print_self do |x| #notice no symbol
         p "#{role_name} #use role_name to refer to the role of said name
      end
   end
end

Known bugs
There are a few known bugs. The two major once are that #{...} syntax in strings can't beused. This is due to
limitaion/bug in the current version of sourcify.
If declaring several role methods for the same role sourcify might get confused and return the same sexp for
multiple of them. The work around is to use do...end for the role ans {|| } for the role methods
