# The Context class is used to define a DCI context with roles and their role methods
# to define a context call define with the name of the context (this name will become the name of the class that defines the context)
# the name should be a symbol and since it's going to be used as a class name, use class naming conventions
# follow the name with a block. With in this block you can define roles and interactions
# and interaction is defined by write the name of the interaction (hello in the below example) followed by a block
# the block will become the method body
# a role can be defined much like a context. instead of calling the define method call the role method followed by the role name (as a symbol)
# the role will be used for a private instance variable and the naming convention should match this
# With in the block supplied to the role method you can define role methods the same way as you define interactions. See the method who
# in the below example
# = Example
#    Context::define :Greeter do
#        role :who do
#          say do
#            @who #could be self as well to refer to the current role player of the 'who' role
#          end
#        end
#      greeting do
#        p "Hello #{who.say}!"
#      end
#    end
#
#    class Greeter
#      def initialize(player)
#         #@who = player
#      end
#    end
#
#    Greeter.new('world').greeting #Will print "Hello world!"
#maroon is base on Marvin which was the first injectionless language for DCI
#being injectionless there's no runtime extend or anything else impacting the performance. There' only regular method invocation even when using role methods
