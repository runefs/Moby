# Consider street corners on a Manhattan grid. We want to find the
# minimal path from the most northeast city to the most
# southeast city. Use Dijkstra's algorithm
#


#
# --------- Contexts: the home of the use cases for the example --------------
#

#
# ---------- This is the main Context for shortest path calculation -----------
#


# There are eight roles in the algorithm:
#
# pathTo, which is the interface to whatever accumulates the path
# current, which is the current intersection in the recursive algorithm
# east_neighbor, which lies DIRECTLY to the east of current
# south_neighbor, which is DIRECTLy to its south
# destination, the target node
# map, which is the oracle for the geometry
# tentative_distance_values, which supports the algorithm, and is
# owned by the CalculateShortestPath context (it is context data)
#
#
# The algorithm is straight from Wikipedia:
#
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm
#
# and reads directly from the distance method, below


# "Map" as in cartography rather than Computer Science...

# object representing a particular Manhattan geometry
